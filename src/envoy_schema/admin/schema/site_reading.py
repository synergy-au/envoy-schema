    This enum aims to capture allowed csip aus compliant readings for a site as a single value.

    There is some flexibility built in for readings which aren't perfectly compliant (e.g. Kind or data qualifier of 0).
    A future release might include a strict bool flag to enable the use of imperfect readings.

    It assumes the following:
        - The Kind is 37 (POWER, mandatory by csip), 12 (Energy) or 0 (NA)
        - The data qualifier is 2 (Average, mandatory by csip) or 0 (inst)
        - Any RoleFlags are allowed, does not show whether sites are mirrors, DER, submeter, or aggregation points.
            If both site and device information are present (role flags 3 and 73, respectively, site data is returned)
        - Load convention applies: positive is import from the grid. If FlowDirectionType is stored it will be used,
            otherwise it is provided as stored (e.g. Flow type = 0 is not converted).
        - Other options are not filtered (DeviceCategory, CommodityType, etc). All are allowed, none are returned.
